        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: thick;">We are committed to become the bank of choice by providing SUPERIOR, PRO-ACTIVE, INNOVATIVE, STATE-OF-THE-ART Banking services with an attitude of care and concern for the customers and patrons.</p>

        <p style="background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.8); color: orange; padding: 10px;">Ever since large-scale banks began surfacing more than four decades ago, the management
            division of labor has centered on
            products and channels. Each product
            team primarily focuses on meeting
            its individual profit goal for the year,
            with far less emphasis on building
            the overall profitability of each
            customer relationship.
            This system actually can work quite well in a
            strong market, where surging customer demand
            helps to satisfy the essential quest for sales volume.
            In turn, banks see less of a need for a coordinated
            marketing and sales outreach and in-depth
            composite knowledge of customers and households.
